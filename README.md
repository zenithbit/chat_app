# Real-Time Chat Application

1. Overview
This project is a Real-Time Chat Application developed primarily using JavaScript, with ReactJS for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end. The application implements a Client-Server architecture where the front-end is a Single Page Application (SPA), and the back-end is responsible for handling RESTful API requests. The main goal of the project is to create a platform that allows users to connect and chat with each other in real-time via a centralized server.

2. Features
Real-time messaging between connected users
RESTful API for back-end communication
Single Page Application using ReactJS for smooth user experience
Server-side message handling and data management with NodeJS
Client-Server communication using WebSocket for real-time data exchange

3. Technologies
JavaScript: Primary programming language for both front-end and back-end
ReactJS: Framework for building the front-end user interface (SPA)
NodeJS: Framework for building the back-end server that handles API requests
WebSocket: For real-time communication between the client and server
ExpressJS: To create and manage the RESTful APIs
Socket.IO: To enable real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between web clients and servers

5. How It Works
Client-Server Model
The Client-Server model is applied to manage the exchange of information between computers:

Client: The front-end application (ReactJS SPA) sends requests to the server when the user interacts with the interface.
Server: The back-end (NodeJS) listens for client requests, processes them, and responds with appropriate data. WebSocket is used for real-time data exchange, enabling live chat between users.
Real-Time Communication
The server uses Socket.IO to facilitate a real-time connection between clients. This enables instant message delivery without refreshing the page.

6. Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
